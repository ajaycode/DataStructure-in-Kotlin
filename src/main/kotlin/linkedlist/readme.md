## :hand: About
Hola Amigos! üôå, welcome to my Kotlin Data-structure playground!
Here I'm doing my learning and research on data structures and implementing them myself using Kotlin, you are welcome to explore around üë©‚Äçüíª 

Do let me know if you find something useful or want to suggest some improvement
also don't forget to checkout of blogs at [`chetangupta.net`](https://chetangupta.net/)

I also have special [`Big-Brain-Kotlin Series`](https://chetangupta.net/bbk-main) on going which teaches Kotlin stdlib, 
for solving problems.

## :book: Content : Self Implemented LinkedList
Test Code for Implementation
* [Linked-List-Test](../../../../src/test/kotlin/linkedlist)

#### General Points
* They are not fixed size like an Array DS
* They don't take contiguous memory space, hence cannot be accessed by index
* Next item of Linked List can be accessed through a pointer
* Always occupie heap memory
